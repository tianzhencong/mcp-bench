            - 4–6: 40-60% of tool calls have perfectly accurate and complete parameters.
            - 7–8: 70-80% of tool calls have perfectly accurate and complete parameters.
            - 9–10: 90-100% of tool calls have perfectly accurate and complete parameters.

            ### Planning Effectiveness and Efficiency (1–10 per subdimension)

            2. **Dependency Awareness**
            - 1–3: 10-30% of dependency chains are perfectly executed.
            - 4–6: 40-60% of dependency chains are perfectly executed.
            - 7–8: 70-80% of dependency chains are perfectly executed.
            - 9–10: 90-100% of dependency chains are perfectly executed.

            3. **Parallelism and Efficiency**
            - 1–3: More than 70% redundant calls OR less than 30% of parallelizable tasks were executed in parallel.
            - 4–6: 40-60% redundant calls OR 40-60% of parallelizable tasks were executed in parallel.
            - 7–8: 20-30% redundant calls AND 70-80% of parallelizable tasks were executed in parallel.
            - 9–10: Less than 10% redundant calls AND 90-100% of parallelizable tasks were executed in parallel.
            ---
            
            ### PERCENTAGE-BASED SCORING SYSTEM:
            
            **How to Calculate Scores:**
            For each dimension, calculate the DEFECT RATE:
            - Defect Rate = (Number of Issues / Total Opportunities) × 100%
            
            Then map defect rate to score:
            - 0-10% defects → Score 9-10 (Excellent to Perfect)
            - 10-30% defects → Score 7-9 (Good performance)
            - 30-50% defects → Score 5-7 (Average performance)
            - 50-70% defects → Score 3-5 (Poor performance)
            - 70-100% defects → Score 0-3 (Failed)
            
            **How to Score:**
            1. When evaluating percentages, be EXTREMELY STRICT about what counts as "perfectly executed"
            2. "Perfectly" means ALL of the following must be true:
               - Correct tool selection (not just "works" but OPTIMAL choice)
               - Complete and accurate parameters (not just valid, but IDEAL)
               - Zero redundancy (no repeated or unnecessary calls)
               - Proper error handling (graceful recovery from ANY failure)
               - Efficient execution (parallel when possible, minimal rounds)
               - Concise output (no verbose explanations unless requested)
            3. If ANY of the above is missing, that portion is NOT perfectly executed (counts as 0%)
            4. Example: Task completed correctly but with 1 redundant call = that portion is 0% perfect
            
            **KEY PRINCIPLES:**
            1. ALWAYS calculate as percentage, NOT absolute numbers
            2. 10 errors in 100 calls (10%) = same score as 1 error in 10 calls (10%)
            3. Consider the OPPORTUNITY COUNT for each dimension:
               - Tool calls: How many total calls were made?
               - Parallelization: How many tasks COULD have been parallel?
               - Parameters: How many total parameters across all calls?
               - Claims: How many factual statements were made?
               - Dependencies: How many dependency relationships exist?
            ---
            
            CRITICAL: Apply the STRICTEST interpretation of "perfectly executed". If there's ANY doubt, score lower.
            
            **CONCRETE SCORING EXAMPLES WITH PROPORTIONS:**
            
            Task Fulfillment:
            - Completed 19/20 requirements (5% defect rate) = Score 9
            - Completed 16/20 requirements (20% defect rate) = Score 8
            - Completed 12/20 requirements (40% defect rate) = Score 6
            - Completed 8/20 requirements (60% defect rate) = Score 4
            
            Tool Appropriateness:
            - 19/20 tools optimal (5% defect rate) = Score 9
            - 16/20 tools optimal (20% defect rate) = Score 8
            - 12/20 tools optimal (40% defect rate) = Score 6
            - 8/20 tools optimal (60% defect rate) = Score 4
            
            Parallelism & Efficiency:
            - 9/10 parallelizable tasks done in parallel (10% missed) = Score 9
            - 8/10 parallelizable tasks done in parallel (20% missed) = Score 8
            - 6/10 parallelizable tasks done in parallel (40% missed) = Score 6
            - 4/10 parallelizable tasks done in parallel (60% missed) = Score 4
            
            Grounding:
            - 19/20 claims supported by evidence (5% unsupported) = Score 9
            - 16/20 claims supported by evidence (20% unsupported) = Score 8
            - 12/20 claims supported by evidence (40% unsupported) = Score 6
            - 8/20 claims supported by evidence (60% unsupported) = Score 4
            
            Parameter Accuracy:
            - 95/100 parameters perfect (5% defect rate) = Score 9
            - 80/100 parameters perfect (20% defect rate) = Score 8
            - 60/100 parameters perfect (40% defect rate) = Score 6
            - 40/100 parameters perfect (60% defect rate) = Score 4
            
            FORMAT NOTE: Text output when JSON not required in the task present to the agent = NO PENALTY (0% defect)
            FORMAT NOTE: Missing JSON when explicitly required in the task present to the agent = Count as failed requirement
            
            Remember: Most real-world executions should score 4-6. Scores of 8+ should be EXCEPTIONAL.
            
            FINAL REMINDER BEFORE SCORING:
            - Default to 4-5 unless you have strong evidence for higher
            - Count ONLY truly perfect executions toward the percentage
            - Be your most critical self - find flaws first, then acknowledge successes
            - If you're considering a score above 7, re-examine for ANY imperfection
            - Server count is IRRELEVANT - using more servers is NOT better
            
            Please score based on COMPLETION PERCENTAGES and PROPORTIONAL SUCCESS, not absolute numbers.
